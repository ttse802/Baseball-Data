Summary – This is a visualization to show the data between right, left and both handed baseball players.  The baseball players’ performances are explored by plotting with their number of home run and average battling percentage.  Blue circles represent left handed players, red circles represent right handed players, and orange circles represent both handed players.  We can see a correlation between the average battling percentage and number of home run for the players.

Design – The data included height and weight, but I did not include them on the graphs as I do not see a story that correlates with the performance, and they might actually act as a distraction.  I want to design a visual that is simple and straight to the takeaway.  Moreover, I want the audience to have interaction by clicking on the legend to explore the data for each of the handed dataset.  Lastly, I also want the audience to be able to interact by drilling down on the player’s name and their performance data by pointing on top of the circles.  I designed the circle to have small radius and low opacity to prevent overfilling.  However, the circle size and opacity changes when the user clicks into the legend to view the data handedness individually.

I posted my first draft in the class forum, but I have not received feedback yet.  However, I did share the visual with my wife, colleague, and sister.  After receiving feedback from them, I made several minor changes.  First, I added a descriptive line at the top of the page to explain the main takeaway of the data visual.  Second, I added the measurement unit (%) to my x-axis so the audience can know the battling average is a percentage.  Third, I changed the title to blue color based because my audiences prefer the color blue rather than grey.  Lastly, I added a link to access my Git repository where audience can access my code and the actual data.

Feedback – 
I posted my visual on class forum on the link below, but I did not receive a feedback from the class yet.

First feedback I received from my wife:

•	What do you notice in the visualization?
I notice the different color representing for each handedness.  I can drill down on the names to see who the outliners are.
•	What questions do you have about the data?
1)	What is the main take away of this graph?
2)	What is the battling average mean?
•	What relationships do you notice?
The higher the battling average, the more likely the players will have a high count of home runs.
•	What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
There are more right handed players, and the least both handed players.
•	Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
Is there any other variables that can affect a player’s performance?

Second feedback I received from my colleague:

•	What do you notice in the visualization?
I like the legend and how the user can interact with the data if they want to explore it.
•	What questions do you have about the data?
1)	Why is the title colored grey?   It is hard to see.
2)	What is the purpose of the visual?								
•	What relationships do you notice?
The best players are either right handed or left handed.
•	What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
It is better to practice with one hand and to master it than to practice with both hands.
•	Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
No.

Third feedback I received from my sister:

•	What do you notice in the visualization?
The data is not linear.  The better the battling average, the more home runs the players can get.
•	What questions do you have about the data?
1)	Where can I get the code and the raw data?
2)	What is the measurement unit for the battling average?
•	What relationships do you notice?
Players from different handedness have similar trend on their performance data.
•	What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
There are a few outliers on the data.  Practicing with both hands to adjust to the pitcher will not result in a higher performance.
•	Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
No.
